<h1>The best TV shows according to Lydia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 TV shows of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Harlots</h3>
<p>Harlots is a drama series set in the 18th century London following the story of a bawd and her two daughters. Though the scene is set in the 18th centery the show has many modern twists including the choice of music played throughout the show. The plot feels fresh, original, and well thought out.</p>
<h3>The Great</h3>
<p>This show is by no means historically accurate but by all means very entertaining. The Great is set in 18th century Russia (I guess I have a thing for the 18th century). Following Catherine the Great and her husband Peter. If you're into having your heart ripped out and then sewn back in to then be ripped out again all while laughing, then this one is for you.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>This is not a TV show but I had to give it an honorable mention. All I'll say is it's super fruity and I'm here for it, and if you think its not you need to read between the lines. That's a hill I'll happily die on.</p>
