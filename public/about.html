  Hello! My name is Lydia Gray and I am 22 years old living in the great state of Oregon. I am originally from Utah but decided to branch out and move about two years ago. I am a Web Developer as well as a proffesional dancer. I started myweb development journey as just a way to gain more financial control over my life andto work as my own boss however it quickly became something i actually enjoyed and am passionate about. Talk about luck right?
